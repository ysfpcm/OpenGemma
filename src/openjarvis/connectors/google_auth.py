"""Shared Google OAuth helpers: access token read + one-shot 401 refresh.

All Google connectors (Gmail, Calendar, Contacts, Drive, Tasks) authenticate
with the same OAuth flow and store identical token payloads at
``~/.openjarvis/connectors/*.json`` — typically a shared ``google.json`` file
plus per-product copies. They all need the same refresh-on-401 behavior, so
the wrapper lives here instead of being duplicated per connector.

Use ``call_with_refresh(api_fn, credentials_path, *args, **kwargs)`` around
any token-taking API helper. On a 401 the wrapper exchanges the stored
``refresh_token`` for a new ``access_token``, updates the credentials file,
and retries the call once. All other status codes propagate.
