"""Shared fixtures for server route tests.

Server tests build apps via ``create_app``, which (with traces enabled by
default) wires a ``TraceStore`` at the real ``~/.openjarvis/traces.db``. Now
that the chat endpoints actually *write* traces, an unguarded run would
pollute the developer's real trace DB and make tests non-hermetic. This
autouse fixture redirects the traces DB to a per-test temp path.
